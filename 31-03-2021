- I learnt the difference between the console and the editor.
- In the console, everything needs to be defined and the code can't be written like 3+2.
- The answer will be an error as the computer doesn't know what to do when it's given a caluculation without any print() statement.
- The editor will answer ot this kind of command because it knows that 3+2=5, hence the answer is going to be 5.
- So basically, the editor has defined data whereas the console doesn't know anything prior to the code we are writing or in other words, the console doesn't have any stored data.
- The colab notebooks are like the editors, they have everything defined and work both the ways, with and without the print statement.
- Check out my Colab Practice Notebook in this repeository for further understanding.
