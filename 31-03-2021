- Started watching MIT 6.0001 on youtube and the topic was what is computation.
- I learnt the following-
    1. What is the difference between humans and robots
    2. print() command in python
    3. int, float, bool, Nonetype, type()
    4. Results of the simple operations using these types numbers- 
        *Addition- if the no. is a float, then the sum is a float and if the no. is an int, then 
         the answer is an int. (same for subtraction and multiplication)
        *Division- the answer is always a float, no matter what.
- Learnt about modulo(%) and raise to the power of(**).
- Modulo is used to find the remainder of the division problem. (8%4 = 0)
- Raise to the power is multiplying the no. (8**2=64)  
- Learnt about the importance of naming in programming and variables, how to name them.
- Figured out the difference of variables in javascript and python.
- Started revising javascirpt in a new website.
- Solving blockly problems.
- I learnt what an object is python.
- There are 2 types of objects, scalar and non-scalar
    1. Scalar- Objects that can't be sub-divided.
    2. Non- Scalar- Objects that can be ascessed or divided.
